# n8n workflow exports

This directory stores version-controlled exports of the discrete n8n workflows used by the browser interview vertical slice.

The deployed n8n instance remains the runtime source for credentials and environment-specific configuration. Exports must never contain credentials or secrets.

Version-controlled workflow exports:

- `02-create-topic-interview-links.json`
- `03-validate-interview-link.json`
- `04-start-voice-interview.json`
- `05-interview-completed.json`
- `06-generate-article.json`
- `07-create-doctor-review-link.json`
- `08-validate-article-review-link.json`
- `09-record-doctor-review-response.json`

The article-generation workflow uses the approved prompt preserved at
`../prompts/article-generation-master-prompt.md`. It is intentionally shipped
with a manual trigger so a completed interview can be tested and reviewed
before automatic generation is enabled.

Current browser endpoints:

- `POST /webhook/aac/interview/validate`
- `POST /webhook/aac/interview/start`
- `POST /webhook/aac/interview/complete`
- `POST /webhook/aac/review/validate`
- `POST /webhook/aac/review/respond`

The live workflows use credentials configured inside n8n. These exports intentionally omit credential bindings and secret values; reconnect the appropriate BigQuery and OpenAI credentials after importing them into another n8n instance.
